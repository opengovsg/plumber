/**
 * To prevent data races, when working on the same excel file, we need use the
 * same session ID across our entire fleet. We should also avoid changing
 * session IDs, as there is a chance of a data race when we do this (e.g. we
 * start writing to the new session before Microsoft has finished propagating
 * the data in the old session).
 *
 * To achieve this:
 * - We store each file's session ID in redis.
 * - We try to keep using the same session ID for each file, until it naturally
 *   expires on Microsoft's server.
 *
 *   Note that Microsoft only expires sessions after a period of inactivity, so
 *   any write we make will always have the maximum possible time window to
 *   propagate to the rest of Microsoft's fleet.
 *
 * Some notes:
 * 1. == The Key System Invariant ==
 *    There must be no concurrent excel requests to different session IDs,
 *    unless all requests (except possibly one) raise an error that informs the
 *    user about this happening (i.e. performing an auto-retry and hiding the
 *    fact that concurrent requests has occurred from the user is not
 *    permissible).
 *
 *    Example:
 *    a) Worker 1 writes to session ID 'abc'.
 *    b) At the same time, worker 2 writes to session ID 'def'
 *    c) At the same time, worker 3 writes to session ID 'xyz'
 *
 *    This example is only OK if at least 2 of the workers above raise a
 *    user-visible error. We must do this because concurrent requests to
 *    different session IDs cause data races on Microsoft's servers, and
 *    Microsoft is known to merge output of the concurrent requests wrongly.
 *    Thus, we need to get the user to check for data correctness if this
 *    happens.
 *
 * 2. All session creation and invalidation must be done under a write lock.
 *    Otherwise, we can end up with an invariant violation like so:
 *
 *    a) Initially, session ID is null.
 *    b) Worker 1 sees that it is null, and requests a new session from Graph
 *       API.
 *    c) Concurrently, worker 2 sees that it is null, and also requests a new
 *       session from Graph API.
 *    d) Worker 1 updates the redis session ID with its Graph API's response,
 *       and then starts performing excel requests with this ID.
 *    e) Immediately after, worker 2 updates the redis session ID with its Graph
 *       API's response, and then starts performing excel requests with this ID.
 *    f) Worker 1 will have performed a concurrent request with a different
 *       session ID, thereby breaking the invariant.
 *
 *    To fix this, we make each worker:
 *    - Acquire a lock before starting to request a new session from Graph API.
 *    - When entering the lock, check that session ID has not been populated by
 *      another worker before firing off a session creation request.
 *
 *    That said... strictly speaking, a lock is not needed:
 *    - If we did not lock, a worker can still check for existence of concurrent
 *      requests to a different session ID, by checking if session ID in redis
 *      _after_ it made its request is the same as the session ID it used to
 *      make the request. If they are different, a concurrent request has
 *      occurred, and the worker needs to fire off a user-visible error.
 *    - The problem is that this no-lock approach causes a user-visible error
 *      cascade in hot pipes. If multiple workers concurrently start work on the
 *      same file when it doesn't have an existing session, they will all make
 *      requests using their own session IDs (following the scenario above),
 *      leading to a user-visible error cascade. This is a UX nightmare.
 *
 * 3. We sync expiry times of the session ID keys in redis (see the
 *    SESSION_ID_EXPIRY_SECONDS constant) to the same time period as Microsoft's
 *    session inactivity timeout. This saves memory and prevents extraneous
 *    retries from "session expired" errors.
 *
 * 4. Read locks should not be needed at all, as far as I can tell.
