/**
 * This implements the getTableRow action, but it's abstracted out so that it
 * can also be used by updateTableRow.
 *
 * ** NOTE **
 * ==========
 *
 * This does a _full table scan_ in order to minimize the number of queries made
 * to M365. This decision was made because a full table scan more than halves
 * the queries needed (from 5 to 2), and we are more constrained by our _very
 * very low_ M365 rate limit than our available compute.
 *
 * A comparison of queries needed:
 *
 * |      WITHOUT FULL TABLE SCAN     |        WITH FULL TABLE SCAN        |
 * | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
 * | 1. Create workbook session.      | 1. Create workbook session         |
 * | 2. Query table address range.    | 2. Query all table rows starting   |
 * | 3. Perform a MATCH() formula     |    from header row, up to the      |
 * |    call on table's address       |    MAX_ROW-th row. Then compute    |
 * |    range to find the 1st row     |    the action output using this    |
 * |    number which satisfies the    |    alone.                          |
 * |    search criteria.              |                                    |
 * | 4. Query table row data using    |                                    |
 * |    row number from MATCH's       |                                    |
 * |    output                        |                                    |
 * | 5. Query table colum names. Use  |                                    |
 * |    that and the output from step |                                    |
 * |    step 4 to generate the action |                                    |
 * |    output                        |                                    |
 *
 * The main pitfalls and mitigations for this are:
 *   1. Although we only fetch up to MAX_ROWS rows, fetching large tables with
 *      many columns could take a lot of time. This should be very rare, but if
 *      this ever becomes common we could mitigate it by querying only the
 *      lookup column first, then making another query to get the full row data
 *      for the matched row.
 *   2. Long strings in cells may cause our scan to be slow. This should also be
 *      rare; if this ever becomes an issue, we could restrict the max length of
 *      the value to match.
